	\begin{itemize}
		\item To follow unified standards and state-of-the-art technologies for
			extension developers, Extbase should feature a clean request/response
			handling in accordance to the
			\href{https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/}{PSR-7 standard}
		\item Therefore, the class
			\small\texttt{TYPO3\textbackslash
				CMS\textbackslash
				Extbase\textbackslash
				Mvc\textbackslash
				Request}\normalsize\newline
			now implements the PSR-7
			\texttt{ServerRequestInterface}
		\item This lets developers access request-related information from the core
		\item The interface is, for example, available within Extbase controllers:\newline
			\texttt{\$this->request}

% The extbase TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Mvc\Request now implements the PSR-7 ServerRequestInterface and
% thus holds all request related information of the main core request in addition to the plugin namespace specific extbase arguments.

% To further prepare extbase towards PSR-7 compatible requests, the extbase TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Mvc\Request has to be streamlined.

% We have implemented unified standards and state-of-the-art technologies for developers in previous TYPO3 releases by following well-known PSR standards.
% We kept our promise to continuously improve the TYPO3 ecosystem and had a closer look at which areas we could improve further in this regard.

% To let developers achieve this, Extbase now implements a “ServerRequestInterface”.
% Accessing request-related information from the core is as easy as pie.
% The details are all available through $this->request within Extbase controllers.
% This change also results in a streamlined class “\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Mvc\Request” and in several deprecations, for example the methods getRequestUri() and getBaseUri().
