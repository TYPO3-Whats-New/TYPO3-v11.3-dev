		TYPO3 version 11.3 is the fourth sprint release on the way to the LTS-version
		(long-term support) scheduled on 7 September 2021.\newline
		This sprint release excels with a bunch of backend UX improvements.
		User experience (UX) is about how users interact with a system or web
		interface.

		\vspace{0.2cm}

		In addition to PHP version 7.4, the TYPO3 Core is now also compatible
		with PHP version 8.0. Developers can leverage many new features,
		optimizations, and improvements of the programming language that powers
		TYPO3.

		TYPO3 developers and contributors should be aware that this release is the
		last release before the \textbf{feature freeze} for the v11 cycle on
		7 September 2021. Now is a good time to submit your code contributions
		to the TYPO3 Core if you want to see them in TYPO3 v11 LTS.
